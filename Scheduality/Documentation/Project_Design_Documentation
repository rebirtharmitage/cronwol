    Methodoloy : Design of the system queries
    
        Create An Event
        
            Steps in process...
            
                1. user submits request through webpage interface
                2. form sends POST to the server and starts PHP backend
                3. request is already filtered by the javascript front end so no filtering is needed here
                4. event table entry is created with the customer's information and event
                5. information is emailed to provider and the user
                6. confirmation webpage is brought up for the user
                
                Form Information [from webpage in step 2]
                
                    user is logged into the system to get to this page so that information is submitted from the
                    customer's cookie information on the site at the submission time.
                    
                    event id is created by the page and is a unique 12 character VARCHAR 
                    
                    provider id information comes from the webpage javascript use XML lookups to indicate who is 
                    available based on the schdule prior to logging in.
                    
                    service selected from menu again from the webpage
                    
                    start_time is a time stamp again filtered from the front end webpage
                    
                    end_time is a duplicate from the start_time except it is set by the service_time_increments value
                    
                    location_id again comes from the website scheduling for the business which is filtered through
                    javascript to the user on the front end page
                    
                    email_sent is a boolean value to track if the customer's information was sent via email
                    
                    customer_confirmed is a tracker that the business can use if the customer has paid for or have a 
                    credit for the service.
                    
                    loyalty_points is a sum of the services previously listed to determine how many loyalty points to 
                    add to the customer upon signing up for the service.
                    
                Process Continued...
                
                    After this information is put into the database it effects all other user who also are looking to 
                    sign up for service.   This changes the way the information work by way of the Javascript lookups.
